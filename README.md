# LangChain CCXT Code Generator and Deployment on Vercel

This project is a cryptocurrency trading algorithm code generator that leverages LangChain, an AI-powered language model from OpenAI, and the CCXT library for cryptocurrency exchange integration. The goal is to simplify the process of creating Python code tailored to specific trading requirements.

## Overview

Cryptocurrency trading involves complex strategies and technical implementations. This tool aims to bridge the gap between trading expertise and programming skills by automatically generating Python code for various trading tasks. The generated code includes functionalities such as fetching market data, placing orders, and implementing trading strategies using the CCXT library.

## Features

- **Automatic Code Generation**: Users input their trading requirements, and the tool generates Python code tailored to those specifications.
- **Annotation and Explanation**: Each line of the generated code is annotated to explain its role in the overall strategy, ensuring clarity and understanding.
- **Customization and Improvement**: The generated code serves as a starting point that users can further customize and improve based on their feedback and iterative interactions with the language model.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Code Generator

1. Navigate to the project directory.
